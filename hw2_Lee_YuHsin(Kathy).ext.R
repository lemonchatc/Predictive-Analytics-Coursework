#  while hr17 has the largest positive impact on cnt. For each additional 
#  humidity increases, the count of rental bikes decreases 102. If the time
#  is 17:00, the count of rental bikes increases 339. Within season variables,
#  Summer has less negative impact on cnt than Spring and Fall. Within hour
#  variables, hours between 00:00 and 05:00 have negative impact. Hours between 
#  06:00-22:00 have positive impact on cnt, especially 7-9am, 12-13pm, and 
#  16-19pm. Compared with other weather variables, weathersit3 (light snow, 
#  light rain + thunderstorm + scattered clouds, light Rain + Scattered clouds)

# 9.	Summarize, briefly, what the managers of the bike rental concern should 
#     know about the prediction models found. How effective are the models?  
#     What model should be used to predict in the future (year 3)?
#     How confident are you in future predictions? 

#  The count of rental bikes is highly correlated with temperature, feeling 
#  temperature, hours, and humidity. The warmer the weather is, the more bikes
#  will be rented. Furthermore, it is expected that people are more likely to 
#  rent a bike during commuting hours, such as 8am and 16-19pm. 
#  I am confident that mod4 should be used to predict in the future as it 
#  explains nearly 70% of variation in the count of rental bikes.


# 10.	Are there any transformations of the variables that can be added to 
#     improve the model fit (e.g., squared variables)? Are there any interaction 
#     variables (products of variables) that can be added?  Try at least one 
#     variable with higher order terms (e.g., squared,) and at least one
